Frontend Development Journey

ðŸš€ My Frontend Development Journey

This repository contains all the projects, exercises, and mini-apps Iâ€™m building as I follow the Frontend Developer Roadmap. It includes hands-on practice with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks like React, along with real-world project examples.

ðŸ“Œ Each folder represents a project or concept from the roadmap.

Stay tuned as I grow and learn step by step! ðŸŒ±
